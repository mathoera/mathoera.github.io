## **Unit Testing**
### **Technique - White Box Testing**: This involves testing the internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality. For example, developers might use statement coverage or branch coverage to ensure all code paths are tested.

### **Technique - Code Reviews**: Peer reviews of the code to identify any potential issues early.

## **Integration Testing**

### **Technique - Black Box Testing**: This involves testing the interfaces and interactions between integrated units without knowing the internal workings. For example, testing the data flow between a login module and a user dashboard.

### **Technique - Incremental Integration Testing**: Testing is done by integrating two or more modules that are logically related and then testing them as a group.

## **System Testing**

### **Technique - Functional Testing**: This ensures that the software functions as expected. For example, verifying that a user can successfully complete a purchase on an e-commerce site.

### **Technique - Non-Functional Testing**: This includes performance testing, security testing, and usability testing. For example, testing how the system performs under a high load.

## **Acceptance Testing**

### **Technique - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: This is performed by the end-users to ensure the system meets their requirements. For example, a client might test a new feature to ensure it works as expected in their business process.

### **Technique - Beta Testing**: Releasing the software to a limited audience outside of the development team to get real-world feedback.
